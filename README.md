# ALCON Surveillance Backend

Wave VMS is a Flask and Socket.IO surveillance service. It reads NVR RTSP
streams, runs shared YOLO and InsightFace models, associates faces with
person detections, recognizes registered employees, tracks ROI visits, saves
finalized detection events, and sends live frames and alerts to the Android
client.

This repository is being refactored incrementally. The active behavior still
lives in `alcon_stream_new.py`; the package modules introduced so far are
compatibility boundaries and small ownership modules. That distinction is
intentional: moving a stateful function is only safe after its shared state
and import dependencies have been identified.

## Run

Use the project virtual environment on Windows:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe app.py
```

The server listens on `0.0.0.0:5000` by default. `python app.py` imports the
`main()` entry point from `alcon_stream_new.py`, initializes Firebase, loads
the models and database, starts enabled camera workers, and runs Flask-
Socket.IO with the threaded async mode.

## Current Architecture

```text
app.py
  -> alcon_stream_new.main()
		 -> Firebase initialization
		 -> camera configuration and state initialization
		 -> shared YOLO person model
		 -> shared YOLO vehicle model
		 -> one InsightFace buffalo_l instance
		 -> registered-face cache and auth accounts
		 -> one DetectionEventManager per enabled camera
		 -> CameraManager
				-> one camera_worker thread per enabled camera
					  -> RTSP read/reconnect
					  -> person detection
					  -> optional vehicle detection
					  -> InsightFace detection
					  -> face/person/ROI validation
					  -> individual-template recognition
					  -> camera-local identity memory
					  -> event manager and Socket.IO frame output
```

`app.py` is already a small launcher. `camera/manager.py` owns worker
lifecycle. `events/detection_events.py` owns the packaged
`DetectionEventManager`, and `database/detection_database.py` owns persisted
detection records. `camera/rtsp.py`, `ai/models.py`, and the root-level
compatibility files currently re-export behavior from the active monolith.

## Shared Runtime State

The following process-wide objects must remain singletons during the staged
refactor:

- `CAMERAS`
- `camera_states`, `camera_captures`, `latest_annotated_frames`
- `camera_event_managers`
- `known_embeddings`, `known_face_templates`, `known_person_metadata`
- `person_detector`, `vehicle_detector`, `face_app`
- `gpu_inference_lock` and its face-inference compatibility alias
- `alert_history`, `connected_clients`, `shutdown_event`, `camera_manager`

Camera worker state such as unknown presence, last vehicles, last faces, and
identity memory is deliberately local to each worker. Do not replace it with
a process-wide dictionary unless the behavior is kept camera-specific.

## Configuration

Camera definitions remain in `config/cameras.json`. Each item contains the
camera ID, display name, NVR address, KPI, enabled flag, channel, and subtype.
Environment overrides are supported for each camera:

```env
ENABLED_CAMERAS=CAM001,CAM003
CAM001_NVR_IP=115.247.225.82
CAM001_CHANNEL=1
CAM001_SUBTYPE=2
CAM001_ENABLED=true
```

`ENABLED_CAMERAS=ALL` enables every configured camera. Invalid camera IDs are
rejected. `config/cameras.py` is now the owner of this loading behavior.

The active ROI values are in `roi/camera_rois.py`. `CAMERA_ROIS` contains one
independent entry for every configured camera. Edit only the camera you want:

```python
CAMERA_ROIS["CAM001"]["points"] = np.array([
	[0.10, 1.00],
	[0.12, 0.82],
	# ... normalized [x, y] points ...
], dtype=np.float32)

CAMERA_ROIS["CAM001"]["vehicle"] = {
	"points": np.array([
		[0.00, 0.35],
		[1.00, 0.35],
		[1.00, 0.70],
		[0.00, 0.70],
	], dtype=np.float32),
}
```

`get_camera_roi(camera_id)` returns a copy, and the worker passes its own
camera ID into every ROI check. Changing `CAM001` therefore cannot modify
`CAM002`. The initial values are the exact existing production polygon and
vehicle polygon. Vehicle detection checks the box center and bottom-center
against `vehicle.points` using point-in-polygon; detections outside the
polygon are ignored.

## End-to-End Workflow

### Startup

1. `app.py` imports `main` and calls it.
2. `.env` is loaded and paths are resolved relative to the project directory.
3. Firebase is initialized from `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` or `pythonai.json`.
4. Enabled camera records are loaded and camera state dictionaries are created.
5. H.264 configuration is requested from each enabled NVR using HTTP digest auth.
6. The person YOLO model, InsightFace `buffalo_l`, and vehicle YOLO model are
	loaded once per process.
7. One `DetectionEventManager` is created for each enabled camera.
8. The SQLite schema is checked without replacing the existing database.
9. Registered face embeddings and metadata are loaded into the live cache.
10. Default admin/user accounts are inserted only when absent.
11. `CameraManager` starts one daemon worker per enabled camera.
12. Flask-SocketIO starts and signal handlers stop workers on shutdown.

### Per-camera frame processing

Each worker repeatedly opens its configured RTSP URL and reconnects after
repeated read failures. Every second frame is processed. The worker:

1. Detects person boxes with YOLO class `0` and existing plausibility checks.
2. Runs vehicle YOLO only for vehicle-KPI cameras at the existing cadence.
3. Filters vehicles through the current camera's `vehicle.points` polygon;
	the box center or bottom-center must be inside the polygon.
4. Runs InsightFace under the one global inference lock.
5. Rejects low-confidence, geometrically invalid, out-of-ROI, or
	non-person-associated faces.
6. Matches the live embedding against every stored template for every person.
7. Establishes or retains identity only when spatial continuity confirms the
	same active track. Memory expires after the configured timeout.
8. Builds known, unknown, vehicle, and camera-specific event payloads.
9. Passes tracked events to `DetectionEventManager`.
10. Draws annotations, resizes and JPEG-encodes the frame, updates camera
	 state, and emits `face_frame`.

### Recognition

Registration requires exactly five uploads named `image1` through `image5`.
Each image must contain exactly one InsightFace detection. Each embedding is
normalized and stored independently in `registered_face_embeddings`.
Recognition compares the live normalized embedding against every template,
keeps the best score per person, ranks people globally, and applies the
existing threshold and margin. It does not average templates for live
recognition. `known_embeddings` remains as a legacy compatibility cache.

### Event and alert workflow

`DetectionEventManager` tracks person and vehicle boxes within each camera's
ROI. Events are finalized on confirmed exits, use the configured historical
frame offset for the image, and are written through `DetectionDatabase`.
Unknown groups are held until the last member exits. Alert deduplication,
unknown presence timing, and vehicle context remain camera-aware.

Finalized events emit `detection_event`. Person alerts are appended to the
bounded in-memory `alert_history`, emitted as `face_alert`, and sent to all
active FCM devices using the existing payload fields.

## HTTP API Contract

The following routes currently exist. Methods, paths, request fields, status
codes, and response shapes are compatibility contracts.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/register-person` | Register five face images and employee metadata; returns `201` |
| PATCH | `/api/update-person/<registration_id>` | Update supplied employee fields |
| DELETE | `/api/delete-person/<registration_id>` | Delete registration, embeddings, and image folder |
| POST | `/api/admin/login` | Admin login and FCM token registration |
| POST | `/api/user/login` | User login and FCM token registration |
| POST | `/api/admin/logout` | Deactivate an admin FCM token |
| POST | `/api/user/logout` | Deactivate a user FCM token |
| GET | `/alerts/<filename>` | Serve finalized alert images |
| GET | `/known-faces/<storage_key>/<filename>` | Serve registered face images |
| GET | `/api/cameras` | List configured cameras and status |
| GET | `/api/cameras/<camera_id>` | Return one camera |
| GET | `/api/status` | Return selected camera status and frame availability |
| GET | `/api/mobile` | Combined Android response with alerts, detections, cameras, and snapshot |
| GET | `/api/known-faces` | List known storage keys |
| GET | `/api/registered-employees` | List registered employee records and images |
| GET | `/api/registered-employees/<registration_id>` | Return one employee |
| GET | `/api/alerts` | Return in-memory alert history |
| GET | `/api/detections` | Return persisted detection events |
| GET | `/api/snapshot` | Return the latest selected-camera JPEG as base64 |
| POST | `/api/test-notification` | Send a test alert using the latest default-camera frame |

Socket.IO handlers are `connect`, `disconnect`, `join_camera`, and
`leave_camera`. The server emits `face_frame`, `face_alert`, and
`detection_event`. Camera rooms use the `camera:<camera_id>` naming convention.

## Database and Files

The existing database is `known_faces/known_faces.db`. It contains the
registered-person, five-template embedding, legacy embedding, authentication,
FCM token, detection-event, and detection-record data used by the service.
The refactor does not create a replacement database or regenerate embeddings.

Registered images remain at:

```text
known_faces/<storage_key>/image_1.jpg
known_faces/<storage_key>/image_2.jpg
known_faces/<storage_key>/image_3.jpg
known_faces/<storage_key>/image_4.jpg
known_faces/<storage_key>/image_5.jpg
```

Alert images remain in `alert_images/` and are exposed under `/alerts/`.

## Refactor Status and Migration Map

The completed safe phase is configuration and ROI ownership:

- `config/cameras.py` owns camera JSON parsing and enabled-camera selection.
- `roi/camera_rois.py` owns the exact active person and vehicle ROI values.
- `alcon_stream_new.py` imports those values instead of defining duplicates.
- Existing callers and API behavior remain unchanged.

The next migrations should proceed in this order:

1. Introduce `state/runtime_state.py` and move mutable dictionaries as one
	object, while retaining compatibility aliases for tests and callers.
2. Move the single GPU lock and safe inference wrappers to `detection/gpu.py`.
3. Move database connection/schema helpers and registration SQL into
	`database/connection.py`, `database/persons.py`, and `database/embeddings.py`.
4. Move face detection, cache, recognition, and identity tracking as units;
	each must receive the same state and model objects.
5. Move person/vehicle detection and vehicle tracking without changing model
	arguments or thresholds.
6. Move the worker body to `camera/worker.py`; keep RTSP ownership separate.
7. Move event/alert and Firebase/Socket.IO services.
8. Move routes into an API blueprint only after an automated endpoint map
	comparison passes.
9. Reduce `alcon_stream_new.py` to application assembly and shutdown.

At every step, copy or re-export first, validate imports and behavior, then
remove the old definition. Never instantiate models per worker and never make
separate cache or GPU-lock objects in different modules.

## Circular Import Risks

The main risk is a route module importing the worker while the worker imports
route globals. The intended dependency direction is:

```text
config -> database/state/utils -> detection/face/services
		 -> camera worker -> camera manager -> API -> app
```

Application assembly should pass model, state, socket, database, and event
manager references downward. Mutable process state should be accessed through
one module object, not copied with reassignment-prone `from module import
value` imports.

## Validation

Run the focused suite with:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q
```

Current validation after the configuration/ROI phase: 10 tests pass. Two
existing tests still fail in the GPU helper compatibility area: one patches
`face_inference_lock` while the implementation uses `gpu_inference_lock`, and
one expects an empty YOLO kwargs dictionary even though the production call
must preserve its configured class/confidence/IoU arguments. These failures
were present before this phase and are recorded rather than hidden.

RTSP, Firebase, GPU model loading, and Android delivery require the matching
deployment environment and live services; they are not exercised by the
offline test suite. Before production rollout, verify startup logs, enabled
camera isolation, five-template recognition, event deduplication, FCM
delivery, Socket.IO payloads, and graceful shutdown.

## Files Modified in the Current Phase

- `config/cameras.py`: new camera configuration owner.
- `roi/camera_rois.py`: new ROI configuration owner.
- `alcon_stream_new.py`: imports centralized camera and ROI values, validates
	vehicle detections against camera-specific polygons, and emits recognition
	diagnostics.
- `README.md`: complete architecture, workflow, API, state, migration, and
  validation documentation.
